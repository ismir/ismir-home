# ismir-home

Jekyll version of the ISMIR Homepage


## Contributing (the simple version)

In most cases, this website can be updated by the following process:

* fork the website
* make one or more edits
* create a pull request

For minor changes, it may be sufficient to edit the website source (of your fork) *directly in your web browser*. Once your pull request has been approved and merged, the changes will propagate to the live website.

That's it! Simple, right!?


## Contributing Upstream

Not all of the content in this website originates from *this* repository, which is a downstream consumer of three information sources:

- [conference-archive](http://github.com/ismir/conference-archive): Collection of publication metadata
- [mir-datasets](http://github.com/ismir/mir-datasets): Collection of MIR datasets
- Individual conference websites


### Publication Metadata

If you notice that any publication metadata is incorrect, either here or over at [Zenodo](http://zenodo.org), please submit corrections to the [conference-archive](http://github.com/ismir/conference-archive) repository, which maintains the source data for all ISMIR publications.

This is doubly true for missing PDFs. If possible, please provide a URL or upload the PDF in the issue so that we can more easily fix things.


### Datasets

If you would like to add to or update the [list of datasets](http://ismir.net/resources/datasets/) found on this website, please submit corrections to the [mir-datasets](http://github.com/ismir/mir-datasets) repository, which maintains the collection provided here.


### Conference Websites

The websites of past conferences are being migrated to individual repositories in the ISMIR GitHub organization. Each is being served as a separate GitHub pages site, mapped to the corresponding subdomain.

If you find any **major** issues with these websites, please identify the appropriate repository and create an issue (or ideally a pull request!) there. Please note, however, that these websites are provided primarily for historical purposes, and are in a state of critical-issue only maintenance, *e.g.* only significant issues may be addressed (and even then...).


## Developing Locally

This website is written with Jekyll for simplified automatic deployment via GitHub pages. If you are only ever pushing to master, congratulations! this will be rather transparent.

This feedback loop is slow, however, and it is recommended that bigger changes are developed and tested locally. There are a few things to be aware of when doing so:

### Running the Jekyll development server

Make sure you've installed the `jekyll` tools. See the [instructions here](). To serve the website locally, you must be **inside** the `docs` folder, along side the `_config.yaml` file:

```bash
$ cd ./docs
$ jekyll s --port 4000
```

This will not work from the repository root.


### Local configuration

The first pass at developing this site, @ejhumphrey couldn't figure out how to properly use relative URLs in Jekyll across (a) the config file, (b) layout files, and (c) markdown in a way that worked for both local development and as a project site in GitHub, prior to taking over the http://ismir.net domain. This issue is detailed [more completely here](http://github.com/ismir/ismir-home/issues/??).

Until this is fixed more correctly, a temporary solution has been developed where a single field is specified in the site's `_config.yaml`:

```yaml
base_url: /ismir-home
```

When developing locally, set this to an empty string (`""`) for local development. When pushing to master, this should match the repository name (`/ismir-home`).
