## Transactions of the ISMIR

The open-access journal of the MIR community, the Transactions of the
International Society for Music Information Retrieval (TISMIR), is
[open for submissions](http://transactions.ismir.net/).


## Who are we?

The International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) is a non-profit
organisation which, among other things, oversees the organisation of the ISMIR
Conference. The ISMIR conference is held annually and is the world's leading
research forum on processing, searching, organising and accessing music-related data.


The Society reports recent activities at the yearly ISMIR Community
Meeting (held during the Conference). The slide decks for past conferences are [found here]({{site.base_url}}/about).


## Be a part of the Community!

Between conferences, there are multiple ways to stay involved!

 * [Become an official member of the Society]({{site.base_url}}/membership)
    As a non-profit organization, members are eligible to receive discounted
    registration at conferences and voting rights at the annual business meeting.

 * [Join the ISMIR Community group](https://groups.google.com/a/ismir.net/forum/#!forum/community)
    Since its inception in 2000, the ISMIR community mailing list has grown into
    a forum of over 1,800 members from across the world, and routinely
    receives announcements about conferences, career opportunities, concerts,
    and wide variety of other issues relevant to music information retrieval.
 * [Get involved with Women in MIR (WiMIR) Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wimir)
    Despite the expanding reach of science and technology, there remains a stark
    imbalance between the number of female and male researchers in those fields.
    Regardless of gender or orientation, the WiMIR group is comprised of those interested
    in taking a more active role in building a better support system, improving
    visibility, and ultimately creating a better environment for women in MIR.
* [Join the conversation on Slack](https://slackpass.io/mircommunity)
    Slack is a new way to chat and to gather a community. There are currently more than 400
    people on the Music Information Retrieval Slack's channel, come join the discussion.
