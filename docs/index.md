## Who are we?

The International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) is a non-profit
organisation seeking to advance research in the field of music information retrieval (MIR)&mdash;a field that 
aims at developing computational tools for processing, searching, organizing, and accessing music-related data.
Among other things, the ISMIR society fosters the exchange of ideas and activities among its members,
stimulates research and education in MIR, 
supports and encourages diversity in membership and disciplines, and 
oversees the organisation of the annual [ISMIR conference]({{site.base_url}}/conferences). 
More details on the society and its mission can be [found here]({{site.base_url}}/about).

## ISMIR Conference

The [ISMIR conference]({{site.base_url}}/conferences) is held annually and is the world's leading research forum on MIR. 
More details on past conferences and links to the freely accessible proceedings can be [found here]({{site.base_url}}/conferences).

### Upcoming Conferences

## Transactions of the ISMIR

The [Transactions of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval](https://transactions.ismir.net/) (TISMIR) are the open-access journal of the MIR community. TISMIR was established to complement the widely cited ISMIR conference proceedings and provide a vehicle for the dissemination of the highest quality and most substantial scientific research in MIR. More details on TISMIR and its mission can be [found here](https://transactions.ismir.net/).

## Be a part of the Community!

Between conferences, there are multiple ways to stay involved!

 * [Become an official member of the Society.]({{site.base_url}}/membership)<br>
    As a non-profit organization, members are eligible to receive discounted
    registration at conferences and voting rights at the annual business meeting.

 * [Join the ISMIR Community group.](https://groups.google.com/a/ismir.net/forum/#!forum/community)<br>
    Since its inception in 2000, the ISMIR community mailing list has grown into
    a forum of over 1,800 members from across the world, and routinely
    receives announcements about conferences, career opportunities, concerts,
    and wide variety of other issues relevant to music information retrieval.
    
 * [Get involved with Women in MIR (WiMIR) Group.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wimir)<br>
    Despite the expanding reach of science and technology, there remains a stark
    imbalance between the number of female and male researchers in those fields.
    Regardless of gender or orientation, the WiMIR group is comprised of those interested
    in taking a more active role in building a better support system, improving
    visibility, and ultimately creating a better environment for women in MIR.
    More details on WiMIR and its activities can be [found here](https://wimir.wordpress.com/).
    
* [Join the conversation on Slack.](https://slackpass.io/mircommunity)<br>
    Slack is a new way to chat and to gather a community. There are currently more than 400
    people on the Music Information Retrieval Slack's channel, come join the discussion.
