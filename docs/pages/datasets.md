## [Resources]({{relative_url}}/resources) / Datasets

The list of datasets presented here pulls from the [mir-datasets](https://github.com/ismir/mir-datasets) repository; if you'd like to add a dataset, create an issue / pull request there and the changes will propogate here.

The community owes a huge thanks to the hard work of Alexander Lerch in compiling and maintaining this [list of datasets](http://www.audiocontentanalysis.org/data-sets/).
