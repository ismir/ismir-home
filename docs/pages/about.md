## About the Society

The International Society of Music Information Retrieval is a non-profit
organization seeking to advance the access, organization, and understanding
of music information. As a field, music information retrieval focuses on the
research and development of computational systems to help humans
better make sense of this data, drawing from a diverse set of disciplines,
including, but my no means limited to, music theory, computer science, psychology,
neuroscience, library science, electrical engineering, and machine learning.

More formally, the objects of the Corporation are:

1. To foster the exchange of ideas between and among members whose activities,
though diverse, stem from a common interest in music information retrieval.

2. To stimulate research, development, and improvement in teaching in all
branches of music information retrieval.

3. To encourage publication and distribution of theoretical, empirical, and
applied studies.

4. To cooperate with representatives of other organizations and disciplines
toward the furtherance of music information retrieval.

5. To support and encourage diversity in membership and the disciplines involved
as a fundamental aspect of the society.


ISMIR was incorporated in Canada on July 4, 2008. It was previously run by a Steering Committee.
