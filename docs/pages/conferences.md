## Previous Conferences

Each year, the ISMIR conference is held in a different corner of the world
to motivate the presentation and exchange of ideas and innovations related to
the intentionally broad topic of music information. Historically, the call for
papers (CFP) is announced in the beginning of the year (February-May) via the
community mailing list, and conferences are held several months later (August-November).

With the exception of the scientific proceedings, the format of the conference
varies slightly from year to year; the local organizers are encouraged to leave
their unique mark on the conference, and the greater society is continually
experimenting and improving upon the event.

The open exchange of ideas and respectful, harassment-free scientific debate are
central to ISMIR. In their application, conference organisers must agree in writing
with the [code-of-conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com). They must
also agree to publish it on the conference website, and to enforce it throughout
the conference.
