### Communities 
* The Digital Musicology Study Group of the International Musicological Society (IMS) has regular informal meetings in conjunction with various venues where musicology, computer science, and engineering meet. The ISMIR society acknowledges that there are many ties between the ISMIR community and this study group, which often gathers informally during ISMIR conferences, for example during the Unconference session or as a lunch session. We as a society, want to support these intersocietal activities. As an ISMIR member, one is welcome to join the Digital Musicology Study Group.
